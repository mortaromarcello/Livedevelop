  "description": "Workspace number using default, built-in or custom theme, scrolling to switch workspace, right click menu: workspaces with icons of running apps + Extension Manager (installed extensions, preferences, enabling/disabling, restaring/reloading).\n\n--- What's new (UR = under review, use link above to install manually) ---\nv3: Autoclose submenus on GS 3.6 and 3.8 similar to GS 3.10 native behavior.\nv2: Updated German, Russian and Ukrainian translations.\n\n\u2022 Workspaces. If you have YAWL window list extension installed the app icons in Alternative Activities menu are in the same order as the one you manually choose on the task bar by dragging app icons.\n\n\u2022 Extensions. Extensions can be sorted by name or by the frequency of access. There is also an option to show favorite extensions only (all other extensions will be placed in a submenu).\n\n\u2022 Themes. Some GNOME Shell themes completely change the look of the Activities button, hiding its text and showing an image instead etc. There is an option that forces the Activities button to look like all other panel buttons. There are also several built-in themes and an option to use your own custom theme. The extension comes with 2 custom themes (stylesheet_custom.css and stylesheet_custom2.css) to illustrate the possibility.\n\nExtension quick access options:\n- Extension preferences\n- Soft restart (disable + enable)\n- Hard restart (reload extension's code: useful especially for extension developers)\n- Hide extension* (remove from the list of favorite extensions)\n- Disable extension\nAdditional extension options:\n- Show extension* (select extension as favorite)\n- Enable extension\n* These options are only available if you opted to show favorite extensions only.\n\n\u203c Warning \u203c The extension uses the native Gnome Shell's Activities button, and just substitutes its text with the current workspace number. It is compatible with most extensions hiding the Activities button such as, for example, Applications menu or YAWL taskbar, however, some extensions remove the Activities button and actively monitor if something tries to restore it. In such cases, the Alternative Activities extension cannot restore the button, and instead shows a message indicating such a case. Also, some extensions may not support Hard restart due to reasons beyond my reach.\n\nIf you keep up with the latest GitHub version, checkout branch 'aa' and run `install-extension aa` to update after pull. You need some dev-libraries installed. Please consult README.md for further details.\n\nExtension is translation-ready. There is a Wiki page on GitHub with instructions. Please report problems and suggestions here or on GitHub.",
