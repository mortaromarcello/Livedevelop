You can also export/import settings to back up, sync or share.\n\nDefault mouse actions include (see/adjust all mouse actions in preferences):\n1) Window Thumbnails:\n- Scroll up/down: Window Peeking ON/OFF + change thumbnails opacity\n- Left click: focus window\n- Middle click: maximize/restore window\n- Right click (or Shift+left click): minimize window\n2) App Icons:\n- Scroll: change workspace (if thumbnails are shown: stick to app)\n- Left click: show app's top / next window\n- Shift+left click (double click): minimize top (all) app window(s)\n- Right click: show app menu\n\nThe first time you install the extension it welcomes you with preference dialog.
